            <p>- In all parts of the world and most of the time there is<br/> 
                a surplus in agricultural production in a product,<br/>
                 so the supply is more than the demand, so losses are great, which <br/>
                 makes producers produce less and therefore prices rise, which<br/>
                  causes the consumer to be reluctant.</p>
        <p> -agroExchange found the solution when this problem occurred, which <br/>
             is to return to the old method of trade based on exchange, where<br/>
             whoever had a surplus in a particular product would replace it <br/>
             with another product from another country, and this product would witness a shortage <br/>
             in his country and thus the product would be able to overcome its losses. </p>
        <p>-agroExchange website offers you the opportunity to market your surplus product<br/>
             and replace it with another that you can market in the place where you live. <br/>
             All you have to do is register on the site to be able to place an advertisement containing <br/>
             all the necessary data for other producers to see and the exchange process will take place.</p>
